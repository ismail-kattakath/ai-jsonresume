export const DEFAULT_COVER_LETTER_CONTENT = `I am excited to apply for the Lead Full Stack Software Engineer role where I can leverage my proven track record in leading frontend teams and delivering high-performance web applications. In my recent position as Senior Software Engineer at Homewood Health Inc., I resurrected an abandoned MEAN-stack application, modernized it with AngularJS-to-Next.js migration, and achieved 99.5% uptime while reducing deployment time by 92% and cutting production incidents by 65%. This experience directly aligns with your need for a leader who can "architect and implement micro frontend solutions that enable independent deployment and team autonomy."

My role as Lead Software Engineer at Etuper Technologies Pvt. Ltd. sharpened my ability to establish coding standards, conduct code reviews, and mentor junior developers—skills you highlighted as essential for driving technical decisions and owning the frontend architecture roadmap. I routinely managed sprint planning, backlog prioritization, and blocker resolution, ensuring continuous delivery and fostering a culture of technical excellence.

I have extensive hands-on experience with React.js and Next.js, having led teams to build responsive, accessible applications that integrate smoothly with backend services. My work on the healthcare platform included implementing OAuth 2.0 PKCE flows for SSO integration and configuring SAML 2.0 authentication across multiple partners, demonstrating a strong grasp of security best practices—an important aspect of your quality & performance expectations.

I am eager to bring my experience in scalable frontend architecture, rigorous testing practices, and cross-functional collaboration to your team. I look forward to discussing how my background can help drive the next generation of micro frontends at your organization.`
